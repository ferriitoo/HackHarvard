## Description

EffiSTEM empowers users to personalize their learning experience, enabling the Large Language Model to adapt its explanations in a manner that suits the individual learner. We've observed that when a user specifies their interests, such as hobbies, the LLM leverages this information to explain complex technical concepts using language and analogies that resonate with the student. Users can also select a YouTube playlist and upload their own notes for a STEM subject, providing the LLM with access to relevant content aligned with their interests.

EffiSTEM is your go-to companion for effective studying, whether you're preparing for an upcoming exam or seeking to learn independently. It's ready to assist you anytime, anywhere, even in the absence of an instructor.

## Built with

In our project, we utilized React.js for the Front-End and Flask for the Back-End development. To enhance the functionality and features of our system, we integrated various APIs, including Google's Speech to Text API, MathPix for state-of-the-art STEM OCR, and LangChain for the efficient development and deployment of Large Language Models. We also employed instruction fine-tuning as a strategy to mitigate model hallucinations and improve the accuracy of the system.

### Dependencies

### Front-End (React.js)

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing within the application.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the Flask back-end and external APIs.
- **Material-UI**: A UI framework for creating responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **Redux** (optional): For managing complex state if needed.
- **JWT-Decode**: Used for handling JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API Client Library]: If you're using Google's Speech to Text API.
- [MathPix API Client Library]: For integrating MathPix for STEM OCR.
- [LangChain API Client Library]: For integrating LangChain's LLM development services.

To install these dependencies, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
